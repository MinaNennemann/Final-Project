LiteraryGems- Quotes App

This repository contains a React web application that allows users to explore quotes from various authors which I build as my final project. It includes features like searching for quotes, viewing quotes of the day, managing favorite quotes, and learning about different authors. The data is sourced from a custom JSON file that includes author names, their quotes, and the respective years.
